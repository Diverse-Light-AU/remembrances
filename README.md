# remembrances

A repository dedicated to preserving the legacy of fallen Undertale fans.

---

## Purpose

This repository exists to **preserve memory**, not to create spectacle.

Within many online communities - especially those built around games, art, and shared worlds - people leave lasting impressions that are easy to feel, but easy to lose. Accounts go inactive. Servers are deleted. Worlds are revamped. Over time, names fade, even when the impact remains.

**remembrances** is an archival project meant to document, respectfully and carefully, the lives and legacies of members of the Undertale community who have passed away, as remembered by those who knew them and the spaces they helped shape.

This is not a drama archive.
This is not a rumor hub.
This is not an attempt to speak over families or close friends.

It is a place to remember.

## What This Repository Is

* A **memorial archive**, written in Markdown
* A place for **documented remembrance**, not speculation
* A space where community history can exist **outside of algorithms**
* Versioned, transparent, and preservable by design

Each entry focuses on who a person was, how they were remembered, and the impact they left behind—not on sensational details or exploitation of loss.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

* Not a callout or exposé repository
* Not a substitute for personal grief or private mourning
* Not an authority over someone’s life story
* Not exhaustive, definitive, or immutable

Memory is imperfect. This repository acknowledges that.

### Submissions, Corrections, and Removal Requests

To keep this repository organized, transparent, and accountable, **all submissions and requests must be made through GitHub Issues**.

This includes:

* requests for corrections or clarifications
* additions of new information or context
* requests for removal or revision of existing content

Using Issues ensures that changes are documented, traceable, and handled with care. No changes will be made based on private messages or off-platform requests.

All requests are reviewed with respect, restraint, and consideration for those directly affected.

---

## Ethical Boundaries

This project operates under a few non-negotiable principles:

* **No speculation presented as fact**
* **No unnecessary medical or graphic detail**
* **No monetization**
* **No sensational framing**

If a family member or close friend requests:

* a correction
* a clarification
* or the removal of content

Those requests will be respected.

Preservation should never come at the cost of harm.

## Contributions

At this time, contributions are handled cautiously.

If you believe someone should be remembered here, or if you have firsthand information that may help preserve an accurate legacy, please understand that inclusion is **not automatic**. Consent, credibility, and community context matter.

A contribution guide may be added in the future once clear standards are established.

---

## Why This Exists

Because digital spaces forget by default.

Because communities move on faster than memory can keep up.

And because some people mattered enough that letting their names quietly disappear feels wrong.

---

## Final Note

This repository is maintained as part of the **Diverse Light AU organization**, but it stands apart from fiction, roleplay, or creative canon. It exists purely as an act of remembrance.

To those remembered here:
You mattered.
You still do.
